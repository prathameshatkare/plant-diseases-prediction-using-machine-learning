# Plant Diseases Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict plant diseases based on image data. It leverages various machine learning algorithms to analyze plant images and provide accurate predictions, enabling farmers to manage plant health effectively.

## Features
- Predicts diseases in various plants.
- Utilizes image classification techniques.
- User-friendly interface for easy interaction.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, Scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas
