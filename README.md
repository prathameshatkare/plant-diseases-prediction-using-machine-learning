Plant Disease Prediction System
Overview
The Plant Disease Prediction System is a machine learning-based solution that predicts diseases in plants using leaf images. By leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image recognition, this system provides early disease detection, which can help in reducing crop loss and improving agricultural productivity.

Features
Image Classification: Predicts plant diseases using leaf images with an accuracy of over 90%.
Real-Time Prediction: Provides disease detection within 2 seconds of image upload via a user-friendly web interface.
Scalable: Capable of handling large datasets for improving predictions.
Technologies Used
Machine Learning: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV
Web Framework: Flask
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Database: SQLite (or MySQL, if applicable)
Deployment: Local or cloud-based deployment

Setup Instructions
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/plant-disease-prediction.git
cd plant-disease-prediction
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Download the dataset:

Download the dataset of plant leaf images from [insert dataset source] and place it in the data/ directory.
Train the model:

bash
Copy code
python train.py
Run the application:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
Access the web interface:

Open your browser and go to http://localhost:5000.
Usage
Upload a clear image of a plant leaf.
The system will analyze the image and display the predicted disease (if any).
Review the results along with confidence scores.
Future Enhancements
Expand the model to include more plant species and disease types.
Deploy the system on cloud platforms for broader accessibility.
Integrate with agricultural databases for additional insights.
